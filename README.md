# Time-series-Forecasting

This repository contains Python code for time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It includes a simulated financial market data example, code for data visualization, model training, and forecasting.

## Overview

Time series forecasting is a valuable technique for predicting future values of a variable based on its historical data points. In this project, we demonstrate how to perform time series forecasting using the ARIMA model, which is a popular choice for analyzing and predicting time series data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:


2. Run the Python script `time_series_forecasting.py`:


3. The code will generate simulated financial market data, visualize the time series, split the data into training and testing sets, fit an ARIMA model to the training data, and provide a forecast for future values.

4. You can modify the script to work with your own time series data.
